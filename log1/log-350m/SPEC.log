WARNING! Known issue detected:


An Out of Memory Error has been thrown.
This is an unfortunate but expected error for some configurations.
The heap size needs to be increased or the amount of live data decreased.

In a peak run where tuning is allowed, use JVM argument -Xmx or equivalent.
In a base run, it is possible to configure the harness.
For more info, see ./docs/KnownIssues.html
